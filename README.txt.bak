 Improvements

1. Optimized File Existence Check: 
    - Implemented using a `defaultdict` for O(1) time complexity when checking if a video with the same size already exists.

2. Retry Mechanism:
    - Added a retry mechanism to handle temporary errors, such as `FloodWaitError`, ensuring robust error handling.

3. Chill Shutdown:
    - Implemented a chill shutdown that asks the user for confirmation before exiting and cancels all ongoing tasks properly.

4. Detailed Logging:
    - Enhanced the logging to provide detailed information about each step, including fetching messages, starting downloads, and handling errors.

5. Print Statements:
    - Updated and standardized print statements, providing consistent and clear output.

 Configuration

Create a `theconfig.ini` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:
